    <div class="head2 three"><h2>Easy French Fries</h2></div>

    <p>Learn how to make French fries that are super crispy with this twice-fried method. I don't think most people realize that any decent French fry needs to be fried twice. The first frying is done at a lower temperature, which softens the potato and prepares the starchy surface for the second frying's crispification.</p>

    
        <ul><div id="ing"><h3>Ingredients</h3></div>
            <li>1 large russet potato, cut into evenly sized strips            </li>
            <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed            </li>
            <li>salt to taste            </li>
            
        </ul>

        <ol><div id="stp"><h3>Steps</h3></div>
            <li>Soak potato strips in a large bowl of water for about 30 minutes. </li>
            <li>Pat with paper towels until thoroughly dry. </li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Gently add potatoes to the hot oil and fry for about 5 minutes, stirring and flipping the potatoes occasionally. </li>
            <li>Use a slotted spoon to transfer potatoes to a paper towel-lined plate. Let cool completely. </li>
            <li>Heat oil again, but this time to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Add potatoes and fry a second time until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. </li>
            <li>Remove from the deep-fryer and blot with a paper towel. Sprinkle with salt to serve. </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            
        </ol>
